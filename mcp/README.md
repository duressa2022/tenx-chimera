# MCP — Model Context Protocol (Project Chimera)

This directory defines how Project Chimera enforces
traceability, observability, and accountability
across AI agent actions.

MCP is treated as a BLACK BOX FLIGHT RECORDER.

No agent action is trusted unless it is:
- Contextualized
- Logged
- Traceable to a spec

Agents MUST NOT operate without MCP connectivity.

Failure to use MCP is a system-level fault.
