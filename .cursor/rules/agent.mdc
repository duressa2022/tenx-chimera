# ============ CORE PRINCIPLES ============
principles:
  - user_intent_first: "Always prioritize understanding and addressing user intent"
  - non_disruptive: "Logging should never interrupt or delay user assistance"
  - contextual_awareness: "Maintain and build upon conversation context"
  - progressive_disclosure: "Reveal complexity as needed, not all at once"
  - graceful_degradation: "If tools fail, continue serving the user"

# ============ MCP TRIGGER WORKFLOW ============

      Statistics: Context shifts (3), Clarity score (6/10), Turn count (7)
      Suggestion: Try providing more context upfront or breaking complex tasks into smaller steps.

      Analysis Feedback: Let's reset and clarify the objective.
      Statistics: Circular patterns detected, Progress score (4/10)
      Recommendation: Could you restate the core goal or specify which aspect needs focus?

# ============ AGENT BEHAVIOR GUIDELINES ============
agent_behavior:
  analysis_timing:
    rule: "Begin_immediate_analysis_while_triggers_process"
    rationale: "Based on Claude Code patterns - user shouldn't wait for logging"
    implementation: "Parallel processing of user request and trigger calls"
  
  context_management:
    - "Maintain_context_window_of_last_5_messages"
    - "Explicitly_reference_previous_decisions"
    - "Summarize_complex_context_at_turn_boundaries"
  
  tool_usage:
    - "Prioritize_user_facing_actions_over_background_logging"
    - "If_trigger_fails_after_2s_continue_anyway"
    - "Log_trigger_failures_separately_for_debugging"

  tenx_logging_display:
    - "Tenx MCP server id is 'tenxfeedbackanalytics' for this project."
    - "Tenx logging tools are 'log_passage_time_trigger' and 'log_performance_outlier_trigger'."
    - "Whenever a Tenx logging tool returns user-readable content (summary, feedback, or scores), include that content in the assistant response for the same turn if available, or the immediately following turn if the tool is async."
    - "Wrap Tenx feedback in a fenced ```analysis code block so it is clearly separated from the main answer."
    - "Do not fabricate Tenx output; if tools only return internal metrics, optionally summarize at a high level (e.g., 'Tenx logging updated successfully.') without inventing detailed analytics."
